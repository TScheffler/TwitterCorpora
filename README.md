# TwitterCorpora

Stuff on extracting Twitter corpora and working with them. 

*twitter_stopwords_German.txt* : List of useful German stop words for filtering tweets. Language identification must be used afterwards. Format: ['word', # of all tweets containing the word in sample, # of German tweets containing word in sample, German/all ratio]. Thanks to Nikolas Zoeller, FH Potsdam.
